# Energy Consumption Prediction
This repository houses a predictive modeling project focused on energy consumption forecasting. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and time series analysis techniques, this project aims to develop accurate models for predicting energy consumption patterns.

Let's Understand The Problem, ESc is concerned about the effects of global warming on the demand for its electricity. It is worried that the upcoming summer season will put too much strain on its electrical grid, which may lead to blackouts. ESc wants to avoid such a situation and ensure that its customers have a continuous supply of electricity, especially when they need it the most to cool their homes. They aim to understand the main factors influencing energy usage and promote energy-saving practices among their customers instead of investing in additional power plants.


DO WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT A 5-DEGREE TEMPERATURE INCREASE?

Based on prediction, a 5-degree increase in temperature will result in almost a 48% increase in energy consumption which is concerning, and need to find a solution to address it.
